This file implements a markdown parsing and generation service that handles YAML frontmatter extraction and serialization for memory storage. It provides functionality to parse markdown content with YAML frontmatter headers, extract metadata about memories (title, type, author, tags, links, attachments), and regenerate markdown with updated frontmatter. The service acts as a data transformation layer between raw markdown files and the application's memory storage system, supporting rich metadata for organizing and linking memories across a codebase.
