This file implements a persistent, SQLite-backed background job worker service that processes indexing tasks with atomic job claiming, priority-based scheduling, exponential backoff retry logic, and stale job recovery. It manages concurrent job execution with heartbeat monitoring to prevent timeouts and tracks execution history. The worker integrates multiple services (embedding, GitHub, Git sync, LLM, indexer, memory) and implements provider availability checking to pause jobs when external services are unavailable.
