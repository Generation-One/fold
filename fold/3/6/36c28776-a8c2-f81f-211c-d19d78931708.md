This file implements a GitService that provides git integration capabilities for the Fold application, specifically handling auto-commit functionality for the fold/ directory and sync operations to import memories from remote repositories. The service orchestrates git operations (staging, committing, retrieving commit SHAs) with the application's memory management system, integrating with database, storage, embedding, and vector database services. It uses an async/await pattern with tokio for non-blocking git command execution and follows a service-oriented architecture with dependency injection.
