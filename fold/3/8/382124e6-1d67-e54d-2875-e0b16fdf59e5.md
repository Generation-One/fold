This markdown file provides a comprehensive architectural overview of a user management system, detailing the layered structure consisting of database, authentication, user service, and API route components. It documents the dependencies between components, the request/response data flow through the system, and critical security considerations including password hashing, JWT token management, and token revocation. The architecture follows a service-oriented pattern with clear separation of concerns, where each layer has distinct responsibilities and dependencies are explicitly defined to maintain system integrity and scalability.
