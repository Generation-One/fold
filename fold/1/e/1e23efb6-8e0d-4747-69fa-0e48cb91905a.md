This file defines the core type system and data structures for the FileSourceProvider abstraction, enabling unified interaction with multiple file source providers (Git repositories, cloud storage, etc.). It provides configuration types for connecting to sources, information structures for representing sources and files, and notification configuration for change tracking. The architecture uses serializable structs with optional fields to support provider-agnostic operations while allowing provider-specific metadata through flexible JSON fields.
