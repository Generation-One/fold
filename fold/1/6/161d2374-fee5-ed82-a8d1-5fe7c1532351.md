This file implements a LinkerService that automatically creates relationships between memories in a project by analyzing semantic similarity, file path relationships, LLM suggestions, and commit associations. The service acts as a core component in a memory management system, orchestrating multiple analysis strategies (semantic, path-based, and LLM-driven) to discover and suggest meaningful connections between stored memories. It uses a multi-source approach with deduplication and confidence filtering to produce high-quality link suggestions, integrating with embedding, LLM, and vector database services.
