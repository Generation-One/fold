This file implements comprehensive authentication routes for an Axum-based web application, supporting OAuth2/OIDC flows with multiple providers, session management, and API token generation. It handles user authentication, authorization, and token lifecycle management through various endpoints including provider listing, login redirects, OAuth callbacks, and API token CRUD operations. The module uses middleware-based access control to distinguish between public routes, session-protected routes, and auth-protected routes, implementing a layered security architecture with support for both session cookies and API tokens.
