This file implements a ProjectService that handles complete CRUD operations for projects, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion with automatic slug uniqueness enforcement. It integrates with a Qdrant vector database for collection management and an embedding service for vector operations, serving as a core business logic layer that bridges database persistence with vector search infrastructure. The service uses async/await patterns with SQLx for database operations and manages project metadata, team members, and index patterns while maintaining consistency across relational and vector databases.
