This file defines the database schema, types, and query operations for Fold's project management system. It provides data structures for projects including metadata repository synchronization configuration, git provider integration, and decay algorithm settings. The file implements serialization/deserialization support and helper methods for type conversions, serving as the data access layer for project-related operations in the broader Fold system.
