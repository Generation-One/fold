This file defines Express router endpoints for a REST API that handles user authentication, token refresh, and user profile management. It integrates UserService and AuthService to provide secure endpoints for login, token management, and user operations with JWT-based authentication middleware. The file demonstrates a service-oriented architecture pattern where route handlers delegate business logic to dedicated service classes, with centralized database connection management and token-based authorization for protected routes.
