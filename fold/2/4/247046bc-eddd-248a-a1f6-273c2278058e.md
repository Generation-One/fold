This file defines the data models and business logic for tracking team member status in a project collaboration system. It provides a `Status` enum representing three states (Active, Idle, Away) and a `TeamStatus` struct that stores comprehensive information about a team member's current activity, including their task, open files, and session details. The implementation includes utility methods for status conversion, file parsing, and activity checking, with support for database serialization via SQLx and JSON serialization via Serde. The architecture follows a domain-driven design pattern with clear separation between the enum representation and the database record structure.
