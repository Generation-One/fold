This file implements a GitHub-specific file source provider that wraps the GitHubService to provide a unified interface for file operations through the FileSourceProvider trait. It handles repository connections, file retrieval, listing, and change detection for GitHub repositories while managing authentication tokens and webhook notifications. The implementation follows an adapter pattern, delegating actual GitHub API calls to GitHubService while providing trait-based abstraction for multi-source file management.
