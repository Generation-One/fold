This file implements a service for reading and managing OAuth credentials from Claude Code's credentials file located at ~/.claude/.credentials.json. It provides functionality to parse credentials, validate token expiration, and extract subscription information for users with Max/Pro subscriptions. The module uses a service pattern with deserialization support to safely handle credential data and includes expiration checking via RFC3339 timestamp parsing.
