This file contains comprehensive integration tests for the Fold server, focusing on database operations and job lifecycle management. It tests core functionality including database initialization, migrations, CRUD operations for projects, and job state transitions. The tests use an in-memory SQLite database for isolation and employ async/await patterns with Tokio runtime, validating that the database layer correctly handles data persistence, querying, and job status management.
