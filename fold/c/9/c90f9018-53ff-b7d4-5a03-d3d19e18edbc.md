This module defines the core data structures and types for representing directional links between memories in a knowledge graph system. It implements a simplified LinkType enum with four relationship types (Related, References, DependsOn, Modifies) and provides the MemoryLink struct for storing link metadata including source/target IDs, relationship type, and optional context. The module uses Rust's type system and serialization traits to ensure type-safe link management while supporting database persistence through SQLx integration.
