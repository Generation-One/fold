This file implements REST API endpoints for managing LLM and embedding provider configurations in the Fold system, including CRUD operations, OAuth authentication flows, and provider connection testing. It serves as the primary API layer for provider management, handling both standard provider operations and specialized OAuth flows for services like Anthropic. The module uses Axum web framework with async/await patterns and integrates with database operations and external services for provider validation and token management.
