This file defines a UserService interface for user management operations (CRUD) and provides a concrete implementation through a UserController class that handles HTTP requests. It includes a standalone getUserById function that retrieves users from a database with error handling. The file follows a service-oriented architecture pattern, separating business logic (service interface) from request handling (controller), enabling dependency injection and testability.
