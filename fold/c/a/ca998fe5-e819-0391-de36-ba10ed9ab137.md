This file implements a GitHubService that provides Rust bindings for GitHub API operations, including repository information retrieval, file content access, webhook management, and commit fetching. It serves as the primary integration layer between the application and GitHub's REST API, handling authentication, HTTP client management, and data serialization/deserialization. The service uses reqwest for HTTP communication and serde for JSON handling, following a service-oriented architecture pattern with strongly-typed data models for GitHub entities.
