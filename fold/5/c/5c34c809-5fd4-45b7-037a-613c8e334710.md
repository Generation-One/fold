This file implements an IndexerService that scans project directories, detects programming languages by file extension, and generates LLM-based summaries for source files. It manages file indexing with hash-based deduplication storage, integrates with memory and fold storage services, and supports optional git integration for auto-commit functionality. The service uses async/await patterns with tokio for concurrent file processing and maintains file hash tracking to avoid re-indexing unchanged content.
