This file contains integration tests for Phase 2 of the Fold project, covering vector database (Qdrant) operations, memory embedding lifecycle management, bulk operations, attachment cleanup, and asynchronous job queue processing. The tests are structured as async Tokio test cases that validate the interaction between multiple system components including SQLite database, Qdrant vector storage, embeddings service, and job workers. Each test includes detailed documentation of requirements and expected workflows, though implementations are currently stubbed with print statements pending actual integration.
