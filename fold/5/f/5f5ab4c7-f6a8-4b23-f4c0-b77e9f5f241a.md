This markdown file provides comprehensive documentation for using Fold's MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools to query project knowledge, store memories, search codebases, and retrieve AI-ready context. It serves as a skill guide for AI assistants integrating with Fold, detailing core operations through both MCP tools and REST API approaches. The file establishes best practices for semantic searching, memory storage, knowledge graph linking, and includes practical workflow examples and troubleshooting guidance for developers managing project context and institutional knowledge.
