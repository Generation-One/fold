This integration test file validates the FileSourceProvider abstraction layer, specifically testing the provider registry system, GitHub file source adapter, and webhook notification handling. It verifies that providers can be registered, discovered, and queried through a central registry, while also testing GitHub-specific functionality like webhook signature verification and supported event types. The tests ensure the abstraction properly handles multiple file source providers (GitHub, Google Drive) and their capabilities through a unified interface.
