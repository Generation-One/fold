This file provides database operations and type definitions for managing file attachments associated with memories in the system. It defines the Attachment struct with utility methods for file type detection and size formatting, along with CRUD operations (create, read, delete) and filtering capabilities for querying attachments from the database. The module uses SQLx for async database access with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, following a repository pattern for data access abstraction.
