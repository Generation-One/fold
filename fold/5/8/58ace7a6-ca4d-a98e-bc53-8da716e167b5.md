This README.md file serves as the primary documentation and marketing material for Fold, a knowledge management system designed to capture, organize, and retrieve project knowledge across codebases. It explains the core problem (scattered development knowledge), presents Fold's solution (searchable, connected, persistent knowledge), and provides quick-start instructions for setup and integration with AI tools like Claude Code. The file outlines key features including semantic search, knowledge graphs, Git integration, and MCP protocol support, along with the system architecture using Rust, Qdrant, SQLite, and Git-native storage.
