This README.md file serves as the primary documentation and introduction for Fold, a knowledge management system designed to capture, organize, and retrieve project knowledge across codebases using semantic search and AI integration. It outlines the core problem (scattered development knowledge), the solution (searchable, connected, persistent knowledge), and key features including holographic retrieval, semantic search, knowledge graphs, and Git integration. The file provides quick-start instructions, architecture overview, and integration guidance for AI tools like Claude Code, establishing Fold as a bridge between human development knowledge and AI agent understanding.
