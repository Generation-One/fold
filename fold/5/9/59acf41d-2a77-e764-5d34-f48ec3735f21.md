This file defines core user and authentication data models for a memory system application, including User, UserSession, and ApiToken structures with their associated methods. It provides role-based access control through the UserRole enum and implements serialization/deserialization for database and API interactions. The models follow a domain-driven design pattern with SQLx integration for database operations and serde for JSON serialization.
