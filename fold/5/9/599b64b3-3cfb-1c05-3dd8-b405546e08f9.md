This file defines core data models for AI working sessions and session notes in a Rust application. It provides strongly-typed enums for session status and note types with serialization/deserialization support, along with struct definitions for AiSession and SessionNote that map to database rows via sqlx. The models include helper methods for status checking, JSON parsing, and type conversions, establishing the domain entities for tracking AI agent work sessions and their associated metadata.
