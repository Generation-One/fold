This file manages database operations for LLM and embedding provider configurations, including storage, retrieval, and OAuth state management. It defines data structures for provider records with support for authentication types, usage tracking, and metadata timestamps. The module serves as a data access layer for provider management, handling both LLM and embedding provider types with similar schemas and providing utility methods for configuration parsing and token expiration checks.
