This file defines the core data models for organizing projects with role-based access control, git provider integration, and metadata storage configuration. It implements a three-tier permission system (Owner, Member, Viewer) for project-level access control through the ProjectRole and ProjectMember types. The module serves as the foundational data layer for project management, supporting multiple git providers (GitHub, GitLab) and flexible storage backends, with a focus on security and extensibility through well-defined enums and trait implementations.
