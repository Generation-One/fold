This file implements a comprehensive authentication service that handles multiple authentication flows including OIDC providers (Google, Auth0), GitHub OAuth, GitLab OAuth, and API token validation. It manages the complete authentication lifecycle including authorization URL generation, token exchange, user session creation, and token verification. The service uses PKCE flow for security, manages OIDC state verification, and integrates with a database for persistent session and user management.
