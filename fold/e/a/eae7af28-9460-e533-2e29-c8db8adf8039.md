This file implements a GraphService that provides traversal, querying, and analysis capabilities for a memory knowledge graph stored in a database. It enables relationship discovery between memories through various traversal methods (BFS, DFS), context gathering, and impact analysis to understand how changes to one memory affect others. The service uses async database queries with SQLx and implements graph algorithms to support features like finding related memories, analyzing cascading impacts, and building contextual relationships across different memory types.
