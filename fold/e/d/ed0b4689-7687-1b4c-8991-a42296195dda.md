This file contains comprehensive integration tests for the Fold Server's REST API endpoints using the axum-test framework. It tests API functionality against an in-memory SQLite database with mocked services, covering authentication, authorization, and various API operations. The test suite establishes a complete testing infrastructure including database setup, test data creation (users, tokens, projects), and AppState configuration to validate the API layer's behavior in isolation from external dependencies.
