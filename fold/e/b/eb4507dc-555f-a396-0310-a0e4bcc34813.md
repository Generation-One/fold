This file defines the core data models for a project memory system that stores various types of knowledge including codebase information, session summaries, specifications, and git history. It provides enums for MemorySource (Agent, File, Git), MemoryType (Codebase, Session, Spec, Decision, Task, General, Commit, PR), and LinkType to establish relationships between memories. The module uses serialization/deserialization support and database integration via sqlx, implementing a flexible knowledge management system that tracks how information was created and how different pieces of knowledge relate to each other.
