This is the main entry point for the Fold server, a semantic knowledge storage system designed for development teams with git integration and multi-provider LLM support. It initializes the application by setting up tracing/logging, loading configuration, creating application state, and starting background services including a job worker and MCP session cleanup task. The file establishes an Axum-based HTTP server with CORS and tracing middleware, then binds to a configured address to accept incoming connections.
