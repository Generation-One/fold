This file implements a local filesystem-based file source provider that enables reading and listing files from local directories. It serves as a concrete implementation of the FileSourceProvider trait, handling file operations like reading content, retrieving metadata, and listing directory contents asynchronously. The provider uses Tokio for async file I/O and supports path resolution relative to a configurable base path, integrating into a larger file source abstraction system that likely supports multiple storage backends.
