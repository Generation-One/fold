This is a comprehensive technical documentation file that outlines the architecture of the Fold backend system, including its layered design with API, services, and storage components. It documents key services such as Memory Service, Indexer Service, Fold Storage Service, and Job Worker, along with their responsibilities and implementation details. The file serves as the primary reference for understanding the system's structure, data flow, and integration patterns, using ASCII diagrams and detailed descriptions of each component's functionality.
