This file serves as the central module aggregator for all data models used throughout the Fold system, including memories, projects, users, teams, sessions, providers, jobs, and repositories. It acts as a barrel export pattern implementation, re-exporting public types from submodules to provide a clean, unified API for the rest of the application. The module also provides utility functions for generating unique identifiers and retrieving current UTC timestamps, which are fundamental operations needed across the system. This architectural approach centralizes model definitions and simplifies imports throughout the codebase.
