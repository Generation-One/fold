This file implements webhook route handlers for GitHub and GitLab integrations, enabling real-time event processing from these platforms. It provides signature verification and event parsing through the FileSourceProvider abstraction, allowing the system to handle push events, pull requests, and merge requests. The implementation uses HMAC-SHA256 for webhook signature validation and defines comprehensive data structures for deserializing webhook payloads from both providers. This modular approach allows new providers to be added easily while maintaining consistent webhook handling patterns across the application.
