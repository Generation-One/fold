This file implements a filesystem-centric storage service for persisting memories as markdown files with YAML frontmatter metadata. It provides functionality to read, write, and manage memory files organized by project, enabling version control and direct file editing. The service handles directory structure creation, file path management, and serialization/deserialization of memory content with metadata. It uses async Tokio operations for non-blocking filesystem I/O and follows a service-oriented architecture pattern.
