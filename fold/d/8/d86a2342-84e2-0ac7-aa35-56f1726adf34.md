This file implements session-based authentication middleware for Axum web framework, validating session cookies for browser-based access to protected resources like the admin dashboard. It provides two main middleware functions: `require_session` for validating session cookies and injecting user context, and `require_admin` for enforcing admin role requirements. The implementation uses server-side session storage with database validation, cryptographically random session IDs, and secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax) to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
