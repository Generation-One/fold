This file implements a GitLocalService that handles cloning and pulling Git repositories locally using the git2 library for efficient repository indexing. It provides functionality to manage repository clones with support for multiple Git providers (GitHub, GitLab) and authentication via tokens. The service follows an async/await pattern with blocking tasks for synchronous git2 operations, managing repository paths, validation, and updates while handling errors gracefully.
