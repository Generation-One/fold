This file implements a comprehensive authentication and user management module for a Rust-based system. It defines core entities including User and UserRole types, establishes authentication traits and error handling, and provides utility functions for password hashing and user authentication. The code demonstrates idiomatic Rust patterns including trait-based abstractions, enum-based error handling, and module organization with configuration management, serving as a foundational authentication layer for a larger application.
