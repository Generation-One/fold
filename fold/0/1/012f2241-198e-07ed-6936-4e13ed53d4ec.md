This file defines a comprehensive error type system for the Fold application using the thiserror crate, providing ergonomic error definitions that integrate seamlessly with Axum's response system. It encompasses authentication errors, resource errors, validation errors, external service errors, and file handling errors, each mapped to appropriate HTTP status codes. The Error enum implements automatic conversion to HTTP responses with structured JSON error payloads, enabling consistent error handling across the entire application.
