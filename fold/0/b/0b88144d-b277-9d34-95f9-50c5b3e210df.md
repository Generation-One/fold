This markdown document provides comprehensive technical documentation for Fold v2, a holographic memory system designed for codebases that reconstructs full context from memory fragments using vector similarity and explicit relationships. It details the design philosophy applying holographic principles to knowledge management, architectural overview including storage locations and database schema, memory model structure with decay-weighted search capabilities, and implementation patterns for LLM-powered memory processing. The system unifies multiple memory types into a single model with git-native storage, hash-based identity, and background job processing for automatic content analysis and metadata evolution.
