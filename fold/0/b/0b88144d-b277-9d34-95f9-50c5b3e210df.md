This is comprehensive system documentation for Fold v2, a holographic memory system designed for codebases that enables context reconstruction through vector similarity and explicit relationships. It details the design philosophy applying holographic principles to knowledge management, the complete architecture including storage locations, database schema, and memory models, as well as implementation patterns for LLM-powered memory processing and decay-weighted search. The system uses hash-based storage of markdown files in git repositories, SQLite for metadata, and Qdrant for semantic embeddings to create an interconnected knowledge graph.
