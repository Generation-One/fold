This file defines the core data structures and database operations for the Memory system in Fold, which represents knowledge units including code files, sessions, specs, decisions, tasks, commits, PRs, and general notes. It provides type-safe enumerations for MemoryType and SyncSource, along with the Memory struct that maps to database records with comprehensive metadata fields. The file establishes the foundational data model for Fold's knowledge management system, supporting content storage, metadata synchronization, and source tracking across multiple repository platforms.
