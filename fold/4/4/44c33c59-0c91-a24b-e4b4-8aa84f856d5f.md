This module provides a collection of reusable test utilities for the Axum web framework, including helper functions for creating HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with authentication headers and extracting JSON responses. It serves as a centralized location for common testing patterns used across the test suite, reducing code duplication and providing a consistent interface for making authenticated API calls during integration testing. The module uses Axum's HTTP primitives and Serde for JSON serialization/deserialization, following a utility/helper pattern to support test infrastructure.
