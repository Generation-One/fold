This is a comprehensive markdown documentation file for Fold, a holographic semantic memory system designed for development teams. It serves as the primary reference guide covering system architecture, installation procedures, configuration requirements, API usage, and troubleshooting. The documentation outlines Fold's core functionality including vector embedding-based semantic search, automatic memory linking, LLM-powered summarization, and Git integration, while providing practical examples and architectural diagrams for developers implementing or extending the system.
