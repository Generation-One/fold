This file provides comprehensive database query abstractions for managing users, web sessions, and API tokens in a Rust application with OIDC authentication support. It defines data models for users with role-based access control, session management with expiration tracking, and API token authentication with project-level access control. The file uses SQLx for database operations and implements utility methods for role management, token validation, and session expiration checking, following a repository pattern for data access abstraction.
