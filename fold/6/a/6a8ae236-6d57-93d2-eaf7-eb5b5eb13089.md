This markdown file provides comprehensive architectural documentation for a user management system, detailing the layered structure consisting of database, authentication, user service, and API route components. It outlines the dependency relationships between components, describes the request-response data flow through middleware and services, and documents security considerations including password hashing, JWT token management, and token revocation. The architecture follows a service-oriented pattern with clear separation of concerns, where each layer has specific responsibilities and dependencies on lower layers for data persistence and authentication.
