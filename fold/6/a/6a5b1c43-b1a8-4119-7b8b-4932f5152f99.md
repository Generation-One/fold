This file implements a Google Drive file source provider that integrates with a file management system's abstraction layer. It provides placeholder implementations for connecting to Google Drive folders, retrieving file contents, and detecting changes through polling-based mechanisms. The implementation follows the FileSourceProvider trait pattern and is designed to be extended with actual Google Drive API integration once OAuth2 authentication is configured.
