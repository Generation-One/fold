This file contains comprehensive integration tests for multiple LLM and embedding providers including Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and OpenRouter. It tests actual API functionality by making real HTTP requests to provider endpoints using credentials from environment variables. The tests are organized into provider-specific modules and include helper utilities for client creation, API key management, and response validation, following a modular testing pattern with ignored tests that require explicit environment setup.
