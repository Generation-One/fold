This file implements a GitSyncService that processes incoming webhooks from GitHub and GitLab platforms, extracting commit information and automatically creating memory summaries. It serves as the central orchestration point for git event handling, coordinating with multiple services (GitHub, GitLab, LLM, Indexer, Memory) to analyze commits and generate searchable knowledge artifacts. The service uses async/await patterns and integrates with a database layer to persist repository and commit data while leveraging LLM capabilities to create intelligent memory summaries of code changes.
