This file defines Express router endpoints for a REST API that handles user authentication, token management, and user profile operations. It integrates UserService and AuthService to provide login, token refresh, user profile retrieval, preference updates, and account deletion functionality. The implementation uses middleware-based authentication validation and includes error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes. The architecture follows a service-oriented pattern with dependency injection, separating concerns between routing, authentication, and user management layers.
