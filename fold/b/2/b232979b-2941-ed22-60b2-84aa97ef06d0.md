This file implements an IndexService for managing SQLite database indexes with health monitoring and rebuild capabilities. It provides functionality to check index health status, rebuild indexes, and optimize them without full reconstruction. The service is designed as a stateless async service that tracks index statistics including memory count, vector count, and rebuild history, following a service-oriented architecture pattern.
