This file implements an ACT-R inspired memory decay model that calculates how memory strength degrades exponentially over time while being boosted by retrieval frequency. It provides core functionality for blending semantic relevance scores with time-based decay factors to produce combined relevance scores for search results. The module serves as a critical component in a memory/retrieval system, enabling intelligent ranking of results based on both semantic similarity and recency/frequency of access.
