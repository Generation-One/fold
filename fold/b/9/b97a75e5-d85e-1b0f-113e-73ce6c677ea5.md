This file defines the core data models for a background job processing system, including enums for job status, type, and log levels, along with a Job struct that represents a background job with progress tracking and timing information. It provides type-safe abstractions for job management with serialization support for database persistence and API communication. The implementation uses Rust's enum pattern with string conversion methods to bridge between database storage and type-safe Rust code, enabling robust job state management across the application.
