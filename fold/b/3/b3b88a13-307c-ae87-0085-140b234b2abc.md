This file implements a metadata synchronization service that syncs Fold codebase memories and links back to Git repositories as Markdown files stored in a `.fold/` directory. The service handles the complete workflow of cloning/opening repositories, generating metadata files from indexed memories, committing changes under a bot identity, and pushing to remote. It serves as a bridge between the Fold database and Git repositories, enabling persistent storage of AI-generated metadata alongside source code.
