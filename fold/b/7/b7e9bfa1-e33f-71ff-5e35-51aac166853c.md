This file implements a ContentResolverService that retrieves memory content from external storage sources based on storage type. It handles two storage strategies: reading codebase memories from source files via file paths, and reading other memories from the filesystem. The service uses a fallback mechanism that first attempts to read from repository local paths, then falls back to project root paths, with comprehensive error handling and logging for unavailable content.
