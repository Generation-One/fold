//! File Source Provider abstraction.
//!
//! This module provides a generic interface for file sources, allowing Fold to
//! index and track changes from multiple providers:
//! - Git providers (GitHub, GitLab)
//! - Cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive)
//! - Local filesystem
//!
//! Each provider implements the `FileSourceProvider` trait, which defines
//! common operations for connecting, listing files, retrieving content,
//! and receiving change notifications.
