This module defines a generic trait-based abstraction for file source providers, enabling Fold to integrate with multiple file storage backends including Git platforms (GitHub, GitLab), cloud storage services (Google Drive, OneDrive), and local filesystems. It establishes a unified interface for core operations such as connecting to sources, listing and retrieving files, managing change notifications via webhooks or polling, and verifying notification authenticity. The architecture uses async/await patterns with the `async_trait` crate to support non-blocking I/O across heterogeneous provider implementations.
