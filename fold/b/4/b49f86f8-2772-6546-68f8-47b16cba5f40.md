This file implements a Database class that provides a unified abstraction layer for data persistence operations, handling connection pooling, query execution, and transaction management. It serves as a central data access component used by services like UserService and AuthService to perform CRUD operations and complex queries. The class uses a connection pool pattern to manage database connections efficiently and provides generic typed methods for common operations including insert, find, update, delete, and transaction support. The implementation follows a repository-like pattern with specialized query methods for common lookups by id, email, token, and refresh token.
