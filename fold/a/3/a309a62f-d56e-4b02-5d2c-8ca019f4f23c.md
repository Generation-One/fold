This file defines the core data models and enumerations for managing LLM (Large Language Model) and embedding service provider configurations in a Rust application. It provides strongly-typed representations of provider authentication methods (API Key and OAuth), supported providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter for LLMs; Gemini and OpenAI for embeddings), and the LlmProvider struct that encapsulates all configuration data including credentials, OAuth tokens, and provider-specific settings. The models are designed for database persistence using SQLx with serialization support via Serde, following a domain-driven design pattern with type-safe enumerations and conversion methods.
