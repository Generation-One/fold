This file implements a GitLabService struct that provides Rust bindings for GitLab API operations, enabling repository information retrieval, file content access, webhook management, and commit fetching. It serves as the primary integration layer between the application and GitLab's REST API, handling authentication, HTTP client management, and data serialization/deserialization. The service supports both cloud-hosted GitLab and self-hosted instances through configurable base URLs, and implements standard patterns for API client design including header management, URL encoding, and error handling.
