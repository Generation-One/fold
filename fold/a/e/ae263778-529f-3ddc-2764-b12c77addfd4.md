This file defines the central AppState struct that serves as a shared state container passed to all HTTP handlers in the Fold application. It aggregates and initializes multiple domain services including database connectivity, vector search (Qdrant), embeddings, LLM integration, Git operations, authentication, and knowledge graph management. The AppState implements a dependency injection pattern, centralizing service instantiation and configuration while providing a single point of access for all application components.
