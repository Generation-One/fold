This file implements a sophisticated memory management service based on A-MEM principles, providing LLM-powered content analysis, automatic metadata extraction, and memory evolution with intelligent linking decisions. The service integrates with multiple backend systems including vector databases (Qdrant), embedding services, LLM services, and external fold storage for content persistence. It enables holographic context retrieval through link traversal and neighbour metadata updates, creating an interconnected memory system that evolves based on semantic relationships and LLM-driven decisions.
