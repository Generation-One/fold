This file serves as an organizational placeholder for Qdrant vector database integration, re-exporting types and configuration from the services layer while maintaining architectural separation between vector and relational databases. It defines core types for vector operations including SimilarityMetric, VectorSearchResult, VectorStoreConfig, and VectorFilter, enabling type-safe vector search functionality with metadata filtering. The module demonstrates a clean separation of concerns by keeping Qdrant (specialized vector database) distinct from SQLite (relational database), allowing independent scaling and optimization of each persistence layer.
