This markdown document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the Fold v2 file indexing pipeline system. It describes the complete workflow from multiple file sources (GitHub/GitLab webhooks, polling, manual triggers) through a job queue system to job workers that handle repository indexing and processing. The document illustrates a distributed, event-driven architecture designed to handle asynchronous file indexing with support for multiple repository platforms and processing strategies.
