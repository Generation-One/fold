This markdown document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the Fold v2 file indexing pipeline system. It describes the complete workflow from multiple file sources (GitHub/GitLab webhooks, polling loops, manual triggers) through a job queue system to a job worker that orchestrates repository indexing and processing. The document outlines the system's design patterns including atomic job claiming, provider availability checks, repository synchronization, and routing to appropriate handlers, establishing the foundational architecture for a distributed file indexing and analysis system.
