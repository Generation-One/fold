This file implements a comprehensive user management system with authentication capabilities, featuring a UserService class for CRUD operations on users and an AuthService class for token-based authentication. It demonstrates event-driven architecture through EventEmitter integration and includes utility functions for date formatting and user role validation. The code serves as a sample implementation showcasing TypeScript best practices including interfaces, type definitions, async/await patterns, and proper encapsulation with private state management.
