This file contains a comprehensive integration test suite for a Rust-based backend system with multiple functional domains. It tests core API endpoints for project management (CRUD operations), authentication and authorization mechanisms, memory/vector search functionality, webhook integrations, job queue processing, and error handling scenarios. The test suite uses Tokio async runtime and follows a modular test group organization pattern, with each test function documenting expected behaviors through println statements rather than actual assertions, suggesting this is a specification or placeholder test file.
