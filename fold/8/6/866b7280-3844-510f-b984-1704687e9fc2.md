This file defines the data models and database operations for memory links in a knowledge graph system. It provides type definitions for LinkType, LinkCreator, and ChangeType enums, along with the MemoryLink struct that represents link records from the database. The file implements serialization/deserialization support and conversion methods between string and enum representations, serving as the data access layer for managing typed relationships between memories in the knowledge graph.
