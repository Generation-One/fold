This integration test file validates webhook handling functionality for GitHub and GitLab events, including signature verification, event parsing, and database state updates. It provides comprehensive test coverage for webhook processing pipelines, ensuring secure signature validation using HMAC-SHA256, correct event parsing from both providers, and proper database persistence of webhook data. The file uses async/await patterns with a test database setup, helper functions for payload generation, and signature verification utilities to thoroughly test the webhook subsystem.
