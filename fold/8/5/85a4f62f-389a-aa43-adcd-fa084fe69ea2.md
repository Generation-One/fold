This is the root library module for the Fold holographic memory system that serves as the public API gateway for the entire crate. It re-exports core modules (api, config, db, error, middleware, models, services, state) and selectively exposes key types and functions (config, Error, Result, AppState) to external consumers. The file follows a modular architecture pattern where internal modules are declared but only essential public interfaces are re-exported, maintaining encapsulation while providing a clean API surface. This approach enables organized code structure with controlled visibility and simplified external dependency management.
