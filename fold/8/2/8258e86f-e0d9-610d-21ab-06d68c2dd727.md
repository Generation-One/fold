This Rust module implements a comprehensive user authentication and authorization system with role-based access control. It defines core entities (User struct and UserRole enum), authentication logic, password hashing utilities, and a trait-based authentication interface. The file demonstrates Rust's ownership model, pattern matching, and trait implementations while providing a foundation for user management in a larger application.
