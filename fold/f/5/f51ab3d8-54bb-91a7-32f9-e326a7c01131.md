This file implements RESTful API endpoints for managing memories within projects, providing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and semantic search capabilities. It serves as the HTTP routing layer for memory management, handling request validation, parameter parsing, and delegating business logic to database operations. The module uses Axum web framework with structured request/response types and supports filtering, pagination, sorting, and semantic search with similarity scoring.
