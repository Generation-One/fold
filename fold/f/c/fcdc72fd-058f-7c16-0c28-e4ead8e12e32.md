This file implements database query operations for managing git repositories, commits, and pull requests in a Rust application using SQLx. It defines core data structures (Repository, GitCommit, PullRequest) with serialization support and provides repository pattern implementations for CRUD operations and complex queries. The file serves as the data access layer for git-related entities, handling database interactions with type-safe queries and supporting features like webhook management, sync tracking, and file change analysis.
