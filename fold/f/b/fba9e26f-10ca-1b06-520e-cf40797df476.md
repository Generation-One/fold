This module serves as the central router configuration for the Fold application, aggregating all API routes from various domain-specific submodules (auth, projects, providers, webhooks, etc.) into a single unified router. It implements a hierarchical routing structure with appropriate middleware layers, distinguishing between public endpoints, token-protected routes, and admin-only endpoints. The architecture follows a modular pattern where each domain maintains its own route definitions, which are then composed together with their respective authentication and authorization middleware applied at appropriate levels.
