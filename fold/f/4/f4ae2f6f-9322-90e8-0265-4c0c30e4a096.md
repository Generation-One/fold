This file contains integration tests for health check endpoints, system status monitoring, and real-time features in a Rust-based service. It tests critical health check routes (/health, /health/live, /health/ready) and verifies connectivity to external dependencies including databases, Qdrant vector store, and embeddings services. The tests validate system status reporting, uptime calculations, connection pool statistics, and dependency health metrics, ensuring the service can properly monitor its operational state and report comprehensive system information.
