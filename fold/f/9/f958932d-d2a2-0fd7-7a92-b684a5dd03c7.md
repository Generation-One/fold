This file implements a Qdrant-based vector storage service that manages collections for storing and retrieving memory embeddings across projects. It provides core operations including collection lifecycle management (create/delete), point upsert, vector search with filtering, and point deletion with support for metadata-based filtering. The service uses an Arc-wrapped inner structure for thread-safe client sharing and implements a project-slug-based collection naming scheme with configurable prefixes.
