This file implements a persistent background job queue system using SQLite with support for atomic job claiming, priority-based scheduling, exponential backoff retries, and execution history tracking. It defines core job management types (JobType, JobStatus, JobPriority) and database query functions for creating, claiming, updating, and managing job lifecycle. The module serves as the data access layer for a distributed job processing system, ensuring reliable job execution with features like stale job recovery, lock timeouts, and comprehensive job logging.
