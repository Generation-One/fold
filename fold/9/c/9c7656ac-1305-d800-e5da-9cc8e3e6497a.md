This file implements a Database abstraction layer that provides a unified interface for data persistence operations across the application. It manages connection pooling, query execution, and transaction support for services like UserService and AuthService. The class uses generic types for flexibility and implements common CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. It follows the Repository pattern with connection lifecycle management through try-finally blocks.
