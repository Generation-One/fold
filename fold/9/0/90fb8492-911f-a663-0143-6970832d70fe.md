This file serves as the central module aggregator for the Fold application's service layer, organizing and re-exporting 24 specialized services that handle business logic and external integrations. It encompasses embeddings, LLM providers, vector storage, memory management, file storage, git operations, authentication, and various provider APIs (GitHub, GitLab). The file follows a modular architecture pattern where each service is defined in its own module and selectively exported through a barrel export pattern, enabling clean separation of concerns and controlled API surface.
