This module provides comprehensive SQLite connection pool configuration management through the PoolConfig struct, which encapsulates all pool parameters including connection limits, timeouts, and SQLite-specific pragmas. It offers multiple preset configurations (default, high-concurrency, low-memory, and test) to support different deployment scenarios and workload patterns. The module builds and applies both connection options and pool options to optimize SQLite performance for various use cases, implementing a builder pattern for flexible configuration composition.
