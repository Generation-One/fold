This file implements comprehensive health check, status monitoring, and metrics endpoints for the application. It provides multiple health check levels (basic, readiness, liveness), detailed system status reporting including database and service dependencies, background job management endpoints, and Prometheus-compatible metrics. The module uses atomic counters for request/error tracking, startup time monitoring, and defines structured response types for various status queries, serving as the observability layer for the API.
