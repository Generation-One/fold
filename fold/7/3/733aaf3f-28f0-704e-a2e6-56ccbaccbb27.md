This file defines core data models for representing git repositories, commits, and pull requests within the system. It provides serializable structs that map to database records via SQLx's FromRow derive, along with helper methods for common operations like URL generation, SHA formatting, and JSON parsing. The models support multiple git providers (GitHub, GitLab) and include webhook configuration, access tokens, and LLM-generated summaries, serving as the foundation for git integration and repository tracking functionality.
