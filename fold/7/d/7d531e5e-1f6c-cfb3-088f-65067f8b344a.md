This file defines an `AttachmentStorageService` struct that manages file attachments using content-addressed storage with SHA-256 hashing. It provides async methods to store, retrieve, and delete attachments while maintaining references to a SQLite database and storage filesystem path. The service implements a placeholder architecture for a content-addressed storage system where files are organized hierarchically by their hash values, enabling deduplication and integrity verification.
