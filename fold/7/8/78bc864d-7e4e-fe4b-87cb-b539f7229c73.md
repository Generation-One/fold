This file implements REST API endpoints for managing file source repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Google Drive, etc.) connected to projects. It provides unified routing and type definitions for repository operations including connection, synchronization, reindexing, and commit/pull request retrieval across multiple provider types. The module uses Axum web framework with async handlers and follows a provider-agnostic abstraction pattern to support multiple file source backends through a consistent interface.
